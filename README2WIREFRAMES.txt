Please keep in mind that before building any good website you need a template. Ideally for this you want one for the main page
and then another for the content pages. Start by making your wireframes "template mockups" so you can see where everything 
should be placed. Please do not skip this part and keep a sketch or drawing book with you for this part of your webpage builds.
